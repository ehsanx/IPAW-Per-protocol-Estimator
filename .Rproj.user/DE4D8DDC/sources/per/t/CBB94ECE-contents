\caption{Data generating mechanisms describing the desired simulations for comparing sustained treatment strategies. $Z$ is an indicator of randomization group and $B$ is the baseline covariate. $L_{t-1}$ and $L_{t}$ are time-varying covariates at times $t-1$ and $t$, respectively., $A_{t-1}$ and $A_{t}$ indicates treatment received at times $t-1$ and $t$, respectively. $Y_{t+1}$ is the outcome of interest observed at time $t+1$. We assumed no loss to follow-up, and once a subject deviates from protocol, they remain non-adherent for the remaining follow-up.}

For the base scenario (Diagram 1 (i)), the complete list of parameters are listed below. For eq. (\ref{eq:L1}), we set ($\beta_{1-0}$, $\beta_{1-1}$, $\beta_{1-2}$, $\beta_{1-3}$, $\beta_{1-4}$, $\beta_{1-5}$, $\beta_{1-6}$) = (0,	6, -1, -1, 0.25, 0, 0, 0.01). 
For eq. (\ref{eq:L2}), we set ($\beta_{2-0}$, $\beta_{2-1}$, $\beta_{2-2}$, $\beta_{2-3}$, $\beta_{2-4}$, $\beta_{2-5}$, $\beta_{2-6}$) = (-5,	3,	1.25,	0.5,	0	0.25,	0.25). For eq. (\ref{eq:A0}), we set  ($\alpha_{00}$, $\alpha_{10}$, $\alpha_{20}$, $\alpha_{30}$) = (-7.625, 0.4, 0.35, 0, 1.5). For eq. (\ref{eq:A1}), we set ($\alpha_{01}$, $\alpha_{11}$, $\alpha_{21}$, $\alpha_{31}$, $\alpha_{41}$) = (3.35, 0.4, 0.35, 0, 1.5). Finally, for eq. (\ref{eq:Y}), we set $(\theta_{0}$, $\theta_{1}$, $\theta_{2}$) = (-13.44, 6.75, -1.3).
